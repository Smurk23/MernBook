# MernBook

In this challenge i was able to change this app over from a restful API and refactor it to become a GraphQL API along with a built in apollo server, this was no small task and took me quite some time truthfully. Yet i was able to accomplish this by adding my typedef, resolvers, schemas, queries and more.
